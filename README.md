##	R1 - Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.
With this application the main problem that i am looking to solve is that I believe that there is a hole in the market for an application that 
keeps track of player and team stats in details. I am looking to solve this problem by giving this app the ability and the structure to able to support 
new data being added and old data being updated. also with the way the code for this app is designed it would make it very simple to add new data types
and seacrh parameters in the future to track more statistics.

## R2 -	Why is it a problem that needs solving ?
The reason that i am solving this problem is because an application like this would hugly help scouts and 
coaches track the performance of players and other teams. This would be extremely useful when it comes to signing new players and also doing player
performance reviews. Thus this application would make the jobs of scouts and coaches a lot easier and they would also become efficient because 
they would have access to all possible data points involving each player.
