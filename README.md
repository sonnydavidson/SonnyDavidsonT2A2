##	R1 - Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.
With this application the main problem that i am looking to solve is that I believe that there is a hole in the market for an application that 
keeps track of player and team stats in details. I am looking to solve this problem by giving this app the ability and the structure to able to support 
new data being added and old data being updated. also with the way the code for this app is designed it would make it very simple to add new data types
and seacrh parameters in the future to track more statistics.

## R2 -	Why is it a problem that needs solving ?
The reason that i am solving this problem is because an application like this would hugly help scouts and 
coaches track the performance of players and other teams. This would be extremely useful when it comes to signing new players and also doing player
performance reviews. Thus this application would make the jobs of scouts and coaches a lot easier and they would also become efficient because 
they would have access to all possible data points involving each player.

## R3 - Why have you chosen this database system. What are the drawbacks compared to others?


## R4 - Identify and discuss the key functionalities and benefits of an ORM
The key functionalities of an ORM ( Object-relational-mapper ) is that it alows you to write queries using the object-oriented paradigm of your preferred programming language. The benefits of using an ORM are you get to write in the language you are already using, they allow you to connect to the database server, they can help you generate querys to use on your database and they help with fetching the data and serializing it if necessary.


## R5 - Document all endpoints for your API


## R6 - An ERD for your app


## R7 - Detail any third party services that your app will use
This application does not use any third party services. All that is used is flask some other imports to make everything run smoothly.


## R8 - Describe your projects models in terms of the relationships they have with each other


## R9 - Discuss the database relations to be implemented in your application


## R10 - Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project
